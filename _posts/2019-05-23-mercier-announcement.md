My review of Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperberâ€™s *The Enigma of Reason* recently appeared in *Inquiry: Critical Thinking Across the Discplines*.  You can find it [here](https://www.pdcnet.org/inquiryct/content/inquiryct_2016_0031_0003_0033_0044).

I should note that, despite the 2016 date on the journal, I did not in fact review the book before it existed.   I have little confidence in the contributions of clairvoyance to critical thinking.
