Co-author Steve Gimbel and I have just published a book entitled *Personal Memories of Early Analytic Philosophers: Analytic Logic / Synthetic Lives*, with Palgrave Macmillan.  The book is a collection of interviews we conducted with philosophers and mathematicians (such as Peter Achinstein, Franz Alt, Olaf Helmer, Ruth Anna and Hilary Putnam, and Nicholas Rescher), as well as friends and family members of the early analytic philosophers (including spouses and children of Reichenbach, Carnap, Quine, Grelling, and Oppenheim).  The aims of the project are to preserve these voices, many of which are no longer with us, and to preserve our understanding of the human context and personalities from which their work emerged.
