I am, first and foremost, a teacher in the liberal arts tradition.  I see the highest goal of education as intellectual liberation: helping students develop the critical tools to reason freely and fairly about the world, and to develop the creativity required for genuine truth-seeking.  On this page, you can find a list of my current courses, as well as resources for students looking to improve their abilities to research, read, and write philosophy.

## Current Courses

Reasoning
:   We are regular consumers of arguments.  In all likelihood, you've heard arguments for why you should vote a certain way, arguments for what actions are morally right or wrong, arguments for what you should believe in, arguments for which team is going to win, arguments for why you should eat at Dana instead of the Pub tonight.  As a student, you are also asked to make arguments across your courses.  In this class, we will focus on arguments themselves.  What, exactly, is the argument being presented?  How can I tell if it is a good argument or a bad argument?  Most importantly, this is a class in being a critical reasoner - what we can to be better reasoners who are less susceptible to bad arguments and those who wield them.
