I am an Associate Professor of Philosophy and Chair of the [Philosophy Department](https://www.stlawu.edu/offices/philosophy) at [St. Lawrence University](http://www.stlawu.edu).  I earned my BA from [Gettysburg College](http://www.gettysburg.edu) and my Ph.D. from [the Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu).  As a scholar, my work lies at the intersection of the Philosophy of Language, the Philosophy of Mind, and Epistemology, focusing on methodological debates about the role of intuition in linguistics and experimental philosophy.  In addition to those projects, I also work in the philosophy and pedagogy of critical thinking.

I currently live in Canton, NY, with my wife Tina and our delightfully philosophical dog Chompsky.  Outside of philosophy, I am also an avid board gamer, [reader](https://www.librarything.com/profile/jeff.maynes), [runner](https://www.strava.com/athletes/25825590), and [puzzler](www.puzzlers.org).
